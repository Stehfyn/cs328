# CS-328 Assignment #1

### Notes:
The ball has been changed to a matte blue, and the pickup objects have been changed to a matte red. The plane and the static walls are also of a non-default color. Additionally, the number of pickups has been reduced to 9, and are roughly patterned as the golden spiral.
